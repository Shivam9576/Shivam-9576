 <section id="first">
 <span>Holi</span><br>
 <p>Holi festival may be celebrated with various names
 and people of different states might be following different 
traditions. But, what makes Holi so unique and special is 
the spirit of it which remains the same throughout the country
 and even across the globe, wherever it is celebrated</p>

  <section id="second">
 <span>Diwali</span><br>
 <p>Diwali is the five-day festival of lights, celebrated by millions
 of Hindus, Sikhs and Jains across the world. Diwali, which for
 some also coincides with harvest and new year celebrations, 
is a festival of new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil, 
and light over darkness.</p>

 <section id="third">
 <span>Dussehra</span><br>
 <p>Dussehra is also known as Vijayadashami in some regions
 of India. If we set aside the regional differences, 
the main events of this festival have one motto i.e
 the victory of good over evil. In other words, this festival
 signifies the victory of the power of good over that of the power of evil.</p>
